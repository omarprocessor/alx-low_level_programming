0x08. Recursion
Description
This project involves implementing recursive functions in C. Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. Below are the tasks for this project.

Tasks
0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);
File: 0-puts_recursion.c
1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together
Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);
File: 1-print_rev_recursion.c
2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange
Write a function that returns the length of a string.

Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);
File: 2-strlen_recursion.c
3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling
Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

Prototype: int factorial(int n);
If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error.
Factorial of 0 is 1.
File: 3-factorial.c
4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate
Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);
If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1.
File: 4-pow_recursion.c
5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer
Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n);
If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1.
File: 5-sqrt_recursion.c
6. Inception. Is it possible?
Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

Prototype: int is_prime_number(int n);
File: 6-is_prime_number.c
