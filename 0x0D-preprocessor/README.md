0x0D. Preprocessor
Description
This project involves learning and practicing the use of macros and the preprocessor in C programming. The tasks include creating object-like and function-like macros, using predefined macros, and writing programs to demonstrate the functionality of these macros.

Tasks
0. Object-like Macro
File: 0-object_like_macro.h
Description: Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.
1. Pi
File: 1-pi.h
Description: Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.
2. File name
File: 2-main.c
Description: Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line. You are allowed to use the standard library.
3. Function-like Macro
File: 3-function_like_macro.h
Description: Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.
4. SUM
File: 4-sum.h
Description: Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
