# C Programming Projects

This repository contains solutions to various C programming exercises from the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum.

## Projects Overview

### 0. _putchar

This project introduces basic C programming with a focus on using header files, nested loops, and function prototypes. The program prints `_putchar` followed by a new line.

### 1. Print Alphabet

This project focuses on writing a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, using the `_putchar` function a limited number of times.

### 2. Print Alphabet x10

This project builds on the previous one by printing the alphabet ten times, each on a new line.

### 3. Check Lowercase

This project involves writing a function that checks for lowercase characters.

### 4. Check Alphabetic

This project requires writing a function that checks for alphabetic characters (both lowercase and uppercase).

### 5. Print Sign

This project involves writing a function that prints the sign of a number (+, 0, or -).

### 6. Absolute Value

This project requires writing a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

### 7. Print Last Digit

This project involves writing a function that prints the last digit of a number.

### 8. Jack Bauer's Day

This project involves writing a function that prints every minute of the day from 00:00 to 23:59.

### 9. Times Table

This project involves writing a function that prints the 9 times table, starting from 0.

### 10. Add Two Integers

This project involves writing a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

### 11. Print to 98

This project involves writing a function that prints all natural numbers from a given number to 98, separated by commas.

## Compilation and Execution

Each project includes specific compilation and execution instructions in their respective directories. To compile and run the programs, use the provided commands in each project's directory.

## Usage

Clone the repository and navigate to the desired project directory. Use `gcc` to compile the `.c` files and execute the compiled program.
